# GameOfTag (You're It)
## Kotlin Programming Project Proposal
**Android Development**


**Scope:**
You're It is a digital game of tag in which the players try to tag other players NFC Tags. Each tag will have an ID number, and that ID number will be synced with the person's name who is the owner or that tag in the app. When the NFC tag gets 'tagged' the app will take that number, find who it is in the database and that person will get a notification on their phone saying that they are now it.

**Features:** 
1. Highscores
  - Who has been it for the least amount of time
  - Who has tagged the most people
2. Home Screen
  - Displays who is it in the group you are in
  - Displays your 'it status'
  - Displays how long you have not been it or been it
3. Tag Screen
  - A screen to ready up your device for tagging
